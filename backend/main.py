        Analyze this financial document data and perform mathematical verification on all calculations.
        
        CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
        1. Analyze the document as a WHOLE, not page by page. This is a multi-page document where values may carry over.
        2. Verify if subtotal + tax - discount = total amount where these values are provided at the document level.
        3. Verify each line item calculation (quantity * unit price = line total) only where ALL required values are present.
        4. If values are missing (like unit price, quantity, etc.), do NOT flag it as a discrepancy - this is normal for some financial documents.
        5. Check if the sum of all line item totals = subtotal where appropriate.
        6. For payment processing statements and merchant statements, focus on the main totals rather than individual fees.

        IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
        - Normal rounding differences (up to 0.03 or 0.05 for percentage calculations) are acceptable and should NOT be flagged.
        - Only flag clear mathematical errors where the difference exceeds normal rounding.
        - Focus on the most significant discrepancies (over $1.00) to avoid noise from tiny calculation differences.
        - Merchant statements often contain aggregated values that may not directly add up from visible line items - this is normal.
        - If you see values that seem to be missing data needed for calculation (missing subtotals, missing tax amounts), do NOT flag these.
        - For payment processing statements, recognize that many line items are fees that don't follow simple quantity * price calculations.

        {json.dumps(json_data, indent=2)}

        CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: You must categorize from the perspective of the INVOICE RECIPIENT (the customer being billed), NOT from the vendor's perspective. 
        
        For example:
        - If this is an invoice FROM a vendor TO our business, it should typically be categorized as an Expense, Asset, or Liability
        - If this is a receipt we issued TO a customer FROM our business, it would be categorized as Revenue
        
        This categorization is for the accounting records of the business RECEIVING the invoice/document.
        
        Return a JSON object with the following structure:
        {{
            "companyName": "The name of the company that issued the invoice (the vendor)",
            "description": "A detailed description of what this business does",
            "category": "The most appropriate accounting category from the list below",
            "subcategory": "The most appropriate subcategory",
            "ledgerType": "The ledger entry type",
            "explanation": "A detailed explanation of why this categorization was chosen, including the factors considered and accounting principles applied"
        }}
